Disconnect the power and drain hose, and pull your dishwasher out from the counter.  Lay it on its side on a towel.  There WILL be spillage.  Disconnecting the pump is simple. There are a couple hoses, one single wire connection (the thermistor) and one multi-wire plug.  The pump is held in place by apair of thick rubber holders which can be pulled off by hand.  That's it!After removing the pump, I disassembled it to find out why these fail so soon.  It's a very poor design.  I found that the nose of the electric motor, where the bearings are located, sits in a plastic cup formed by the top of the pump body.  Any leakage from the pump around the motor shaft will be held in place against the motor bearing.  It has no place to go.   This causes rusting of the bearing.  I expect I'll be replacing this one in a few years.  :(But kudos to PartsSelect for getting the right pump assembly for me, after getting the wrong one from another supplier!\"},\n",

My only option was to repair the dishwasher or bought a new dishwasher. Therefore, my wife and I decided to , make an attempt to repair this one with a backup plan of buying a new one.

It was leaking from just above tne door front panel, directly underneath the control panel buttons. I opened the dishwasher door, and decided to remove the door screen vent.  I was covered with some offwhite fiberous, or filter like material. I thought perhaps the filter had broken down, and I ordered a new screen. When it arrived, and, although I had expected to receive a new filter with the plastic door screen, I didn't. There wasn't one to be ordered. I looked at the screen again. My problem was, that although I had considered that the substance I had thought was a filter, was instead build up of detergent, and other particals. That idea didn't seem to make sense. I didn't think it was possible for that stuff to get to the door screen. I thought, it was too far away from the dispenser and food particles.  As it turned out, the buildup was, in fact, the problem. I properly cleaned the door vent, which was then fine, and I put it back into the door.  There were no more leaks, that was it, and the problem was solved.  As a last note however, unfortunatley, I have to return the new door vent screen that I ordered.

              "    'completion': \"To fix this problem, our customers have used Dishwasher Drain Pump. Replacing this pump is pretty easy.  Disconnect the power and drain hose, and pull your dishwasher out from the counter.  Lay it on its side on a towel.  There WILL be spillage.  Disconnecting the pump is simple. There are a couple hoses, one single wire connection (the thermistor) and one multi-wire plug.  The pump is held in place by apair of thick rubber holders which can be pulled off by hand.  That's it!After removing the pump, I disassembled it to find out why these fail so soon.  It's a very poor design.  I found that the nose of the electric motor, where the bearings are located, sits in a plastic cup formed by the top of the pump body.  Any leakage from the pump around the motor shaft will be held in place against the motor bearing.  It has no place to go.   This causes rusting of the bearing.  I expect I'll be replacing this one in a few years.  :(But kudos to PartsSelect for getting the right pump assembly for me, after getting the wrong one from another supplier!\"},\n",

I have a Kenmore model that can either be totally installed under counter, left on casters or in my case installed permanently with the 'portable' covers still on. A model that is only for installation in  a cabinet may be different.Open door part way and flex the plastic hinge 'pins' on the kick plate out of the door itself. Once these are out you can close the door and lay the kick plate down towards you. This will expose a spring that is attached to pins on either side of the kick plate and held in place by a rubber cap. Remove the cap, pull the loop of the spring off the pin, and repeat for the other side. At this point you can remove the kick plate and set aside out of the way.There is a second plate behind the kick plate held in place by four screws. Remove the screws with a Phillips head screw driver or a 1/4 inch wrench or socket, then remove the plate and set aside.Now you have exposed the frame rails that somewhat hide the springs, one on each side. If you are lucky, like I was, only one is broken so you can use the other as a guide. Also the installation drawings that came with the part were very helpful. The information supplied by Kenmore in the parts list was no help at all.Follow the 'assembly' found in the kit to assemble the 3 parts of the spring. A this time you may want to open the door halfway then close it and reopen a couple of times and observe how the tail of the door hinge moves, this will show you where the spring is attached. The spring is mostly hidden behind the frame rails but the two connection points are visible with the help of a flashlight. If  one of the springs in still connected, observe the two connection points, one on the tail of the door hinge (top of spring) and the other in a series of slots in the frame rail.With the door closed, hold the spring assembly in one hand (easier said than done) and hook the top of the assembly over the hook on the door hinge. Let it hang down in place and slip the lower part of the assembly into one of the slots. Again if one of the springs is still in place just use the same location as before. If both springs are missing, use one of th slots in the middle.Only one of my springs were broken but I installed new ones on both sides as cheap insurance against doing this again in a few months.Step by step appears a bit complicated but the whole thing only took about 10 minutes.Good luck.\"}]},\n",

After nearly 20 years of use (and no service) my Maytag dishwasher stopped getting dishes clean.  I called Maytag and they made me an appointment with a nearby service center.  The Maytag person also suggested I do a run with an open container in the dishwasher filled with a couple of cups of white vinegar â€“ since that dissolves the whitescale buildup from hard water.   That helped a lot.  Yay Maytag!I had 5 days to wait for service, so I started Googling.  I found very negative reviews of my local service center, but I also learned that I could buy a replacement detergent dispenser online and I found excellent simple instructions for installing it.   It arrived in two days and I installed it.  The hardest part was removing the front panel of the dishwasher to get access and supporting it while taking out the last couple of screws â€“ then holding it in place afterwards while putting the screws back in.   I recommend having a second pair of hands!I also realized that the two rotating spray arms (at the bottom and at the top) werenâ€™t rotating!   Theyâ€™re easy to remove (just unscrew the center component), and I found that many of the holes were clogged â€“ including all the ones pointing sideways that make them spin.   I had to force water inwards through the holes to dislodge the debris, then I filled the arms with water through the center hole and sloshed it around to clear things out.  That worked.  I put it back together â€“ and the dishwasher is now as good as new!For good measure I took the cover off the strainer in the bottom to clean it, but surprisingly the strainer was almost completely clean.I cancelled the service appointment, of course.  Iâ€™m sure I saved a lot of $$$.I had read that recently mandated reformulation of dishwasher detergent with lower phosphate content makes it less effective â€“ but Iâ€™m not seeing that:  a little simple maintenance and my dishes are 100% squeaky clean again!'}]},\n",

I have a Kenmore model that can either be totally installed under counter, left on casters or in my case installed permanently with the 'portable' covers still on. A model that is only for installation in  a cabinet may be different.Open door part way and flex the plastic hinge 'pins' on the kick plate out of the door itself. Once these are out you can close the door and lay the kick plate down towards you. This will expose a spring that is attached to pins on either side of the kick plate and held in place by a rubber cap. Remove the cap, pull the loop of the spring off the pin, and repeat for the other side. At this point you can remove the kick plate and set aside out of the way.There is a second plate behind the kick plate held in place by four screws. Remove the screws with a Phillips head screw driver or a 1/4 inch wrench or socket, then remove the plate and set aside.Now you have exposed the frame rails that somewhat hide the springs, one on each side. If you are lucky, like I was, only one is broken so you can use the other as a guide. Also the installation drawings that came with the part were very helpful. The information supplied by Kenmore in the parts list was no help at all.Follow the 'assembly' found in the kit to assemble the 3 parts of the spring. A this time you may want to open the door halfway then close it and reopen a couple of times and observe how the tail of the door hinge moves, this will show you where the spring is attached. The spring is mostly hidden behind the frame rails but the two connection points are visible with the help of a flashlight. If  one of the springs in still connected, observe the two connection points, one on the tail of the door hinge (top of spring) and the other in a series of slots in the frame rail.With the door closed, hold the spring assembly in one hand (easier said than done) and hook the top of the assembly over the hook on the door hinge. Let it hang down in place and slip the lower part of the assembly into one of the slots. Again if one of the springs is still in place just use the same location as before. If both springs are missing, use one of th slots in the middle.Only one of my springs were broken but I installed new ones on both sides as cheap insurance against doing this again in a few months.Step by step appears a bit complicated but the whole thing only took about 10 minutes.Good luck.\"}]},\n",

Remove the lower access panel from the dishwasher and lower the dishwasher about 1/4 inch in the front and back of the dishwasher). Once you have lowered the dishwasher enough slide the dishwasher out about 6 inches (enough to gain access to the door springs on the left and right side). Remove all broken spring parts and replace using new springs. The left side of the door contained a single heavy duty spring and the right side of the door contained a heavy duty and light duty 'helper' spring. I replaced only the right side springs since the left side spring was in excellent condition. When the springs are installed slide the dishwasher back into its original position and raise the dishwasher back up to its original height using the front and back adjustment screws. Replace the 3 screws holding the top of the dishwasher secure to the bottom of the countertop. Ensure that the door opens, closes and latches smoothly and then replace the lower access panel.

I ordered the parts and they were there in less time than a service tech could come out and i installed the parts and guess what  for 90.00 in parts and 15 minutes in time I repaired my refrigerator. Thanks guys, It took less time to order the parts than it did to make the repair so thanks, your website rocks and is very well designed so my hat is off to you guys!\"},\n",

RISK OF ELECTRICAL SHOCK OR FIRE. DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS REPAIR IF YOU ARE NOT EXPERIENCED WITH ELECTRICAL WIRING.Part Info:The bi-metal strip is clipped onto the evaporator coils and is designed to regulate the defrost coil temperature. If it is not functioning properly you may notice ice buildup preventing air flow (and preventing proper refrigeration), or more rarely the freezer side may get too warm during the defrost cycle.Materials:* Replacement bi-metal strip* Wire cutters* Wire strippers* Wire nuts* Electrical tape* 10MM socketSteps:1: UNPLUG THE FRIDGE! If there is ice buildup, wait until the ice has melted. A box fan blowing at the ice will help melt it more quickly.2: Remove the panel covering the evaporator coils. It's located inside the fridge, on the freezer side.3: Un-clip the bi-metal strip from the evaporator coils.4: Unplug the wires from the evaporator fan, defrost coil and bi-metal strip, then disconnect the main connector that is plugged into the rear wall.5: Clip both wires to the old ( bad ) bi-metal strip. Cut close to the casing of the bi-metal strip so there are long wires to splice onto.6: Strip 1/4 to 1/2 inches of insulation off of the ends of the wires ( depending on the size of the wire-nuts you use). Twist the bare wires slightly to prevent fraying.7: Do the same for the ends of the wires on the (new) bi-metal strip.8: Take the ends of the wires belonging to the (new) bi-metal strip and the wires coming from the main plug. Take the like-colored wires, and twist the bare metal ends together.9: Twist on wire nuts, for both sets of wires. Make sure they are snug, with no bare wire showing.10: Tape over the wire nuts with electrical tape. Tape over the wires nuts in a spiral fashion, completely covering the nut and both wires that are now spliced together. This will prevent accidental shorting.11: Plug the main plug back into the rear wall of the fridge. Also re-connect the connectors to the evaporator fan and defrost coil. Make sure the clips on the connectors are snug to ensure a good connection.12: Clip the new bi-metal strip onto the coils, in the same spot as before. ( Usually just after the small incoming copper tubing that connects to the coils, known as the expansion valve. That is usually the coldest spot on the coils during operation).13: Replace the panel that covers the coils.14: Plug the fridge back in... Now you fridge should defrost correctly. If it does not, your defrost coil could be burned out, or the control board could be faulty.\"}]},\n",

Take the like-colored wires, and twist the bare metal ends together.9: Twist on wire nuts, for both sets of wires. Make sure they are snug, with no bare wire showing.10: Tape over the wire nuts with electrical tape. Tape over the wires nuts in a spiral fashion, completely covering the nut and both wires that are now spliced together. This will prevent accidental shorting.11: Plug the main plug back into the rear wall of the fridge. Also re-connect the connectors to the evaporator fan and defrost coil. Make sure the clips on the connectors are snug to ensure a good connection.12: Clip the new bi-metal strip onto the coils, in the same spot as before. ( Usually just after the small incoming copper tubing that connects to the coils, known as the expansion valve.

Cut close to the casing of the bi-metal strip so there are long wires to splice onto.6: Strip 1/4 to 1/2 inches of insulation off of the ends of the wires ( depending on the size of the wire-nuts you use). Twist the bare wires slightly to prevent fraying.7: Do the same for the ends of the wires on the (new) bi-metal strip.8: Take the ends of the wires belonging to the (new) bi-metal strip and the wires coming from the main plug.

RISK OF ELECTRICAL SHOCK OR FIRE. DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS REPAIR IF YOU ARE NOT EXPERIENCED WITH ELECTRICAL WIRING.Part Info:The bi-metal strip is clipped onto the evaporator coils and is designed to regulate the defrost coil temperature. If it is not functioning properly you may notice ice buildup preventing air flow (and preventing proper refrigeration), or more rarely the freezer side may get too warm during the defrost cycle.Materials:* Replacement bi-metal strip* Wire cutters* Wire strippers* Wire nuts* Electrical tape* 10MM socketSteps:1: UNPLUG THE FRIDGE! If there is ice buildup, wait until the ice has melted. A box fan blowing at the ice will help melt it more quickly.2: Remove the panel covering the evaporator coils. It's located inside the fridge, on the freezer side.3: Un-clip the bi-metal strip from the evaporator coils.4: Unplug the wires from the evaporator fan, defrost coil and bi-metal strip, then disconnect the main connector that is plugged into the rear wall.5: Clip both wires to the old ( bad ) bi-metal strip. Cut close to the casing of the bi-metal strip so there are long wires to splice onto.6: Strip 1/4 to 1/2 inches of insulation off of the ends of the wires ( depending on the size of the wire-nuts you use). Twist the bare wires slightly to prevent fraying.7: Do the same for the ends of the wires on the (new) bi-metal strip.8: Take the ends of the wires belonging to the (new) bi-metal strip and the wires coming from the main plug. Take the like-colored wires, and twist the bare metal ends together.9: Twist on wire nuts, for both sets of wires. Make sure they are snug, with no bare wire showing.10: Tape over the wire nuts with electrical tape. Tape over the wires nuts in a spiral fashion, completely covering the nut and both wires that are now spliced together. This will prevent accidental shorting.11: Plug the main plug back into the rear wall of the fridge. Also re-connect the connectors to the evaporator fan and defrost coil. Make sure the clips on the connectors are snug to ensure a good connection.12: Clip the new bi-metal strip onto the coils, in the same spot as before. ( Usually just after the small incoming copper tubing that connects to the coils, known as the expansion valve. That is usually the coldest spot on the coils during operation).13: Replace the panel that covers the coils.14: Plug the fridge back in... Now you fridge should defrost correctly. If it does not, your defrost coil could be burned out, or the control board could be faulty.\"},\n",

RISK OF ELECTRICAL SHOCK OR FIRE. DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS REPAIR IF YOU ARE NOT EXPERIENCED WITH ELECTRICAL WIRING.Part Info:The bi-metal strip is clipped onto the evaporator coils and is designed to regulate the defrost coil temperature. If it is not functioning properly you may notice ice buildup preventing air flow (and preventing proper refrigeration), or more rarely the freezer side may get too warm during the defrost cycle.Materials:* Replacement bi-metal strip* Wire cutters* Wire strippers* Wire nuts* Electrical tape* 10MM socketSteps:1: UNPLUG THE FRIDGE! If there is ice buildup, wait until the ice has melted. A box fan blowing at the ice will help melt it more quickly.2: Remove the panel covering the evaporator coils. It's located inside the fridge, on the freezer side.3: Un-clip the bi-metal strip from the evaporator coils.4: Unplug the wires from the evaporator fan, defrost coil and bi-metal strip, then disconnect the main connector that is plugged into the rear wall.5: Clip both wires to the old ( bad ) bi-metal strip. Cut close to the casing of the bi-metal strip so there are long wires to splice onto.6: Strip 1/4 to 1/2 inches of insulation off of the ends of the wires ( depending on the size of the wire-nuts you use). Twist the bare wires slightly to prevent fraying.7: Do the same for the ends of the wires on the (new) bi-metal strip.8: Take the ends of the wires belonging to the (new) bi-metal strip and the wires coming from the main plug. Take the like-colored wires, and twist the bare metal ends together.9: Twist on wire nuts, for both sets of wires. Make sure they are snug, with no bare wire showing.10: Tape over the wire nuts with electrical tape. Tape over the wires nuts in a spiral fashion, completely covering the nut and both wires that are now spliced together. This will prevent accidental shorting.11: Plug the main plug back into the rear wall of the fridge. Also re-connect the connectors to the evaporator fan and defrost coil. Make sure the clips on the connectors are snug to ensure a good connection.12: Clip the new bi-metal strip onto the coils, in the same spot as before. ( Usually just after the small incoming copper tubing that connects to the coils, known as the expansion valve. That is usually the coldest spot on the coils during operation).13: Replace the panel that covers the coils.14: Plug the fridge back in... Now you fridge should defrost correctly. If it does not, your defrost coil could be burned out, or the control board could be faulty.\"}]},\n",

RISK OF ELECTRICAL SHOCK OR FIRE. DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS REPAIR IF YOU ARE NOT EXPERIENCED WITH ELECTRICAL WIRING.Part Info:The bi-metal strip is clipped onto the evaporator coils and is designed to regulate the defrost coil temperature. If it is not functioning properly you may notice ice buildup preventing air flow (and preventing proper refrigeration), or more rarely the freezer side may get too warm during the defrost cycle.Materials:* Replacement bi-metal strip* Wire cutters* Wire strippers* Wire nuts* Electrical tape* 10MM socketSteps:1: UNPLUG THE FRIDGE! If there is ice buildup, wait until the ice has melted. A box fan blowing at the ice will help melt it more quickly.2: Remove the panel covering the evaporator coils. It's located inside the fridge, on the freezer side.3: Un-clip the bi-metal strip from the evaporator coils.4: Unplug the wires from the evaporator fan, defrost coil and bi-metal strip, then disconnect the main connector that is plugged into the rear wall.5: Clip both wires to the old ( bad ) bi-metal strip. Cut close to the casing of the bi-metal strip so there are long wires to splice onto.6: Strip 1/4 to 1/2 inches of insulation off of the ends of the wires ( depending on the size of the wire-nuts you use). Twist the bare wires slightly to prevent fraying.7: Do the same for the ends of the wires on the (new) bi-metal strip.8: Take the ends of the wires belonging to the (new) bi-metal strip and the wires coming from the main plug. Take the like-colored wires, and twist the bare metal ends together.9: Twist on wire nuts, for both sets of wires. Make sure they are snug, with no bare wire showing.10: Tape over the wire nuts with electrical tape. Tape over the wires nuts in a spiral fashion, completely covering the nut and both wires that are now spliced together. This will prevent accidental shorting.11: Plug the main plug back into the rear wall of the fridge. Also re-connect the connectors to the evaporator fan and defrost coil. Make sure the clips on the connectors are snug to ensure a good connection.12: Clip the new bi-metal strip onto the coils, in the same spot as before. ( Usually just after the small incoming copper tubing that connects to the coils, known as the expansion valve. That is usually the coldest spot on the coils during operation).13: Replace the panel that covers the coils.14: Plug the fridge back in... Now you fridge should defrost correctly. If it does not, your defrost coil could be burned out, or the control board could be faulty.\"},\n",

It's located inside the fridge, on the freezer side.3: Un-clip the bi-metal strip from the evaporator coils.4: Unplug the wires from the evaporator fan, defrost coil and bi-metal strip, then disconnect the main connector that is plugged into the rear wall.5: Clip both wires to the old ( bad ) bi-metal strip. Cut close to the casing of the bi-metal strip so there are long wires to splice onto.6: Strip 1/4 to 1/2 inches of insulation off of the ends of the wires ( depending on the size of the wire-nuts you use). Twist the bare wires slightly to prevent fraying.7: Do the same for the ends of the wires on the (new) bi-metal strip.8: Take the ends of the wires belonging to the (new) bi-metal strip and the wires coming from the main plug. Take the like-colored wires, and twist the bare metal ends together.9: Twist on wire nuts, for both sets of wires. Make sure they are snug, with no bare wire showing.10: Tape over the wire nuts with electrical tape. Tape over the wires nuts in a spiral fashion, completely covering the nut and both wires that are now spliced together. This will prevent accidental shorting.11: Plug the main plug back into the rear wall of the fridge. Also re-connect the connectors to the evaporator fan and defrost coil. Make sure the clips on the connectors are snug to ensure a good connection.12: Clip the new bi-metal strip onto the coils, in the same spot as before. ( Usually just after the small incoming copper tubing that connects to the coils, known as the expansion valve. That is usually the coldest spot on the coils during operation).13: Replace the panel that covers the coils.14: Plug the fridge back in... Now you fridge should defrost correctly.

Take the like-colored wires, and twist the bare metal ends together.9: Twist on wire nuts, for both sets of wires. Make sure they are snug, with no bare wire showing.10: Tape over the wire nuts with electrical tape. Tape over the wires nuts in a spiral fashion, completely covering the nut and both wires that are now spliced together. This will prevent accidental shorting.11: Plug the main plug back into the rear wall of the fridge. Also re-connect the connectors to the evaporator fan and defrost coil. Make sure the clips on the connectors are snug to ensure a good connection.12: Clip the new bi-metal strip onto the coils, in the same spot as before.

If it is not functioning properly you may notice ice buildup preventing air flow (and preventing proper refrigeration), or more rarely the freezer side may get too warm during the defrost cycle.Materials:* Replacement bi-metal strip* Wire cutters* Wire strippers* Wire nuts* Electrical tape* 10MM socketSteps:1: UNPLUG THE FRIDGE! If there is ice buildup, wait until the ice has melted. A box fan blowing at the ice will help melt it more quickly.2: Remove the panel covering the evaporator coils. It's located inside the fridge, on the freezer side.3: Un-clip the bi-metal strip from the evaporator coils.4: Unplug the wires from the evaporator fan, defrost coil and bi-metal strip, then disconnect the main connector that is plugged into the rear wall.5: Clip both wires to the old ( bad ) bi-metal strip. Cut close to the casing of the bi-metal strip so there are long wires to splice onto.6: Strip 1/4 to 1/2 inches of insulation off of the ends of the wires ( depending on the size of the wire-nuts you use).

I knew the chances of all the freon leaking out was unlikely so I looked at the wiring to the compressor and there was a capacitor and a starter/overload so i figured I would start there. I went on line and found the parts at this site and they were less than the minimum service call charge for a service tech so I figured what the heck let's give her a shot so I did give it a shot. I ordered the parts and they were there in less time than a service tech could come out and i installed the parts and guess what  for 90.00 in parts and 15 minutes in time I repaired my refrigerator. Thanks guys, It took less time to order the parts than it did to make the repair so thanks, your website rocks and is very well designed so my hat is off to you guys!\"},\n",

I ordered the parts and they were there in less time than a service tech could come out and i installed the parts and guess what  for 90.00 in parts and 15 minutes in time I repaired my refrigerator.
